# Hospital-XSLT-Transformations

This repository contains the transformations of a XML file that describes the information - data inside a hospital and its utilities. The XML file is transformed into a responsive HTML one using a XSLT file for the transformations.

This is a project during my postgraduate Studies for the "Semantic Web" course.
